<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> attempting to set forth briefly the principal results
of anthropological research, I find my task beset with many
difficulties. If the clear enunciation of the aims and
methods of physical or biological science is not an easy
matter, difficulties many times greater are encountered in an
attempt to explain the present position of investigation dealing
with mankind from the biological, geographical, and
psychological points of view,â€”subjects that seem to lack
in unity, and that present a number of most divergent
aspects. Owing to the apparent heterogeneity of method,
it seems necessary to explain the aims that unify the many
lines of anthropological research. I can then proceed to
describe what little has been attained, and how we hope to
make further progress.</p>

<p>We do not discuss the anatomical, physiological, and
mental characteristics of man considered as an individual;
but we are interested in the diversity of these traits in
groups of men found in different geographical areas and
in different social classes. It is our task to inquire into the
causes that have brought about the observed differentiation,
and to investigate the sequence of events that have led to
the establishment of the multifarious forms of human life.
In other words, we are interested in anatomical and mental
characteristics in so far as they are peculiar to groups of
men living under the same biological, geographical, and
social environment, and as determined by their past. Thus
we are concerned with the effects of the climate and products<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
of a country upon human life, with the influence of
heat and of cold upon the bodily frame, with modifications
in the life of communities brought about by geographical
isolation, and with those due to the sufficiency or insufficiency
of food-supply. No less interesting to us are the
phenomena of dependence of human life upon those social
conditions that find expression in the customary mode of
nutrition and occupation; in the effects of contact between
neighboring groups of people; in modifications brought
about by migrations; and in the forms of life as influenced
by the density of population. To understand these modifications,
we require a knowledge of individual anatomy,
physiology, and psychology, because the establishment of a
characteristic social group can be brought about only by a
parallel development which occurs in all the individuals
exposed to similar influences.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that the genesis of the types of man,
considered from an anatomical, physiological, and psychological
point of view, is the chief object of anthropological
research. When our problem is formulated in this manner,
we recognize at once that a separation of anthropological
methods from the methods of biology and psychology
is impossible, and that certain problems of anthropology
can be approached only from the point of view of
these sciences. It might perhaps even be said that the investigation
of the types of man is a purely biological
problem, and that the only questions involved are such as
can be treated by the application of those biological methods
which are gradually clearing up the genesis of the
types of animals and plants. A similar claim may be made
in regard to the psychological problems. If there are any
laws determining the growth and development of the
human mind, they can be only laws that act in the individual,
and consequently they must be determined by the
application of individual psychology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>Thus an examination of our problems suggests that the
whole group of anthropological phenomena may be evanescent,
that they may be at bottom biological and psychological
problems, and that the whole field of anthropology
belongs either to the one or to the other of these sciences.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, anthropological phenomena possess a very
genuine interest and unity. This is largely due to the fact
that everything that concerns our own species is of special
interest to us. The feeling of solidarity of mankind, but
more particularly of the individual with his people and
with the class of society to which he belongs, which finds in
our day its strongest expression in the strife of the nations,
has brought it about that the minute differences between
the physical organization of different races, types, and
social groups, have arrested attention much more vigorously
than similar differences in the rest of the animal
kingdom have done; and points of view have early become
important that until recent times have received little attention
on the part of biologists, or that have not yet claimed
their attention. The distribution of distinct psychological
types in man has proved an even more fascinating study,
the investigation of which has led to problems that the inductive
psychology of modern times is not yet ready to
attack.</p>

<p>This centralization of interest in the manifestations of
life in social units has determined the course of development
of anthropology.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Anthropological</span> research leads us to two fundamental
questions: Why are the tribes and nations of the world
different, and how have the present differences developed?
The first question, if it can be solved adequately, will
always lead us to biological and psychological laws that act
on man as an individual, in which we see the single event
mirrored in one broad generalization. But even if we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
should have succeeded in reducing to a series of laws the
multiplicity of events which manifest themselves in the
development of new types and in the growth of new mental
activities, a strong interest will remain in the actual developments
which have occurred among the various peoples of
the world.</p>

<p>This is true not only of anthropology, but also of biology
and genetic psychology, and of other sciences describing
the sequence of events in the universe; and the intense
modern interest in evolution expresses the recognition of
the importance of what might be called the historical view-point.</p>

<p>In this sense, anthropology is the science that endeavors
to reconstruct the early history of mankind, and that
tries, wherever possible, to express in the form of laws
ever-recurring modes of historical happenings. Since written
history covers a brief span of time, and relates in fragmentary
records the fates of a few only of the multitude
of peoples of the earth, the anthropologist must endeavor
by methods of his own to clear up the darkness of past ages
and of remote parts of the world.</p>

<p>While, from this theoretical point of view, anthropology
must devote itself to the investigation of human types and
human activities and thought the world over, its actual
field of work is much more restricted. Biology and psychology
on the one hand, and history, economics, sociology,
and philology on the other, have taken up anthropological
problems, each from its own point of view, and each in
connection with its own subject of investigation. As a
matter of fact, the field of work as theoretically outlined
would require such a vast variety of training, that no
single person could possibly hope to master it. The special
task that is actually assigned at the present time to the
anthropologist is the investigation of the primitive tribes
of the world that have no written history, that of prehistoric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
remains and of the types of man inhabiting the
world at present and in past times. It will be recognized
that this limitation of the field of work of the anthropologist
is more or less accidental, and originated because
other sciences occupied part of the ground before the development
of modern anthropology.</p>

<p>It implies, however, also a point of view fundamentally
distinct from that of history in the narrow sense of the
term. In history we are, on the whole, concerned with
events only that have had an influence upon the development
of our own civilization; in anthropology the life of
every people of the world is equally important. Therefore,
in a wider sense, it is impossible to exclude any part
of mankind from the considerations of anthropology. The
results of studies carried on by the historian and by the
sinologist must not be neglected by the anthropologist in
his endeavors to investigate the history of mankind and
its controlling forces. It will thus be seen that anthropology
differs from history, and resembles the natural
sciences in its endeavor to disregard the subjective values
of historical happenings; that it tries to consider them objectively,
simply as a sequence of events, regardless of
their influence upon the course of our own civilization.</p>

<p>In the vastness of the outlook over the unwritten history
of past ages, the individual is merged entirely in the social
unit of which he forms a part, and we see in the dim distance
of time and space only the movements of peoples, the
emergence of new types of man, the gradual development
of new forms of civilization, and a constant repetition of
processes of integration and disintegration of peoples and
cultures. Prehistoric remains, characteristics of bodily
form, traits of language, industrial and economic achievements,
peculiar customs and beliefs, are the only evidence
that we can use,â€”evidence that was little regarded by
history until the anthropological standpoint began to develop.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Thus it happens that although the anthropologist
may not be able, owing to the specialization of the methods
of inquiry, to investigate problems like those dealing with
the modern history of Europe and China, the historian and
the sinologist will be able to view their problems from an
anthropological standpoint. With the increase of our
knowledge of the peoples of the world, specialization must
increase, and anthropology will become more and more <em>a
method</em> that may be applied by a great number of sciences,
rather than a science by itself.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> shall next take up a consideration of the results of
the biological and psychological researches carried on by
anthropologists. It is somewhat remarkable that these
two large branches of investigation have remained quite
separate, and that the results of the one throw little light
upon the problems of the other. Biological anthropology
has concerned itself chiefly with the classification of races,
their relations to their predecessors and ultimately to the
higher animals; and little progress has been made in the
clearing-up of the genealogical relations of distinct types.
Diligent search has revealed a number of lower forms
which lived during the early quaternary and the late tertiary
periods that help a little in bridging the wide gap between
man and animal; but we are still entirely in the dark
regarding the origin of the fundamental races and of the
types of man. Since observations in different geographical
areas showed at an early time the differentiation of local
types, which it was difficult to define in words, anthropology
was the first of the biological sciences to have recourse to
metrical methods; and the whole modern development of
biometry takes its origin in the application of methods
developed by anthropologists, and by means of which fine
distinctions between closely related types can be discovered.
Originally the metrical methods of anthropologists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
were used for purely taxonomic ends, for the description
of distinct types; and for years chief attention has been
paid to the classification of the types of man according to
their similarities, and to speculation on their relationships;
but, owing to the influence of Francis Galton and his successors,
we are gradually outgrowing this condition, and
we see that more and more problems relating to the influence
of social and geographical environment, of heredity,
of race mixture and selection, are made the subject of
study. This development has been closely associated with
the growth of biometric methods applied to zoology and
botany.</p>

<p>One of the important facts that has been recognized by
a study of the morphology of the races is that man must
be considered as a domesticated animal, and that even those
tribes which are industrially the most primitive are somewhat
removed from the anatomical conditions characterizing
the wild animals. It appears, however, that the degree
of domestication has strongly increased with the growing
complexity of industrial organization; and most of the
races of the present day are anatomically in the same condition
as those types of domesticated animals which are
highly modified by regular feeding and by disuse of a
considerable portion of the muscular system, without, however,
having been subjected to any considerable artificial
selection. This seems to be one of the causes of the high
degree of variability of the races of man.</p>

<p>While it is not yet possible to express definite views in
regard to the relationship of the races of man, a few facts
stand out boldly. We recognize that the two extreme
types of mankind are represented, on the one hand by the
Negro race, on the other hand by the Mongoloid race.
The former of these includes the races of Africa and many
of those inhabiting the large islands surrounding Australia;
the other includes the people of eastern Asia and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
of America. The other strongly divergent types of man
can most readily be classed with these two fundamental
types, and may perhaps be considered as mutants which
developed at an early period. Thus we find affiliated with
the Negro race two divergent types, nevertheless apparently
closely related to it,â€”the dwarfish South African,
who is perhaps intimately related to the many isolated
dwarfish tribes of other parts of Africa and southern Asia;
and the Australian. The Mongoloid type, on the other
hand, has also a considerable number of affiliated types,
which may perhaps represent mutants of this type. Here
belong the Malay of southeastern Asia, the Ainu of northern
Japan, and perhaps the European. If we base our
conception of the division of mankind on this broad outline,
it would appear that two large divisions were established
at an early geological period,â€”the race of the
Indian Ocean, which represents all the Negroid types;
and the race of the Pacific Ocean, which represents the
Mongoloid and affiliated types. The enormous increase in
the number of Europeans during the last two or three
thousand years, and their rapid spread over the surface of
the globe, disturb the clearness of this view; but we must
remember that the white race represented originally only
a very small part of mankind, and occupied only a small
portion of the inhabited world.</p>

<p>What relation the two principal types may have had to
the predecessor of mankind which is represented by the
early quaternary race of Europe is unknown.</p>

<p>The history of the spread of these large races over the
continents remains also, to a great extent, obscure. It
seems likely, however, that the race of the Pacific Ocean
immigrated into America at a very early time, and that
after the retreat of the ice-sheet it swept back into northern
Asia and re-established itself in the whole northern part
of the Old World, which had been uninhabited for long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
periods. Much of this, however, remains hypothesis,
which may be confirmed or disproved by further studies.</p>

<p>While the divergence of the types of man suggests that
the tendency to form mutants has been ever-present, it
would seem that the varieties which have survived up to
the present time have been exceedingly stable, within the
limits of their characteristic ranges of variation. The human
remains found in Europe, which undoubtedly date
back many thousands of years, and the remains of ancient
Egypt, both of which may be compared with the types
represented in the modern population of those countries,
are much like the modern forms, and apparently no change
of type has occurred in these districts for thousands of
years. The same stability of race types manifests itself in
cases of mixture. It would seem that among the human
races there is a strong tendency for hybrids to revert to
either parental type without forming an intermediate race.
Thus we find that in western Asia the low-headed Semitic
type and the high-headed Armenian type persist, although
an intermingling of these people has been going on for
thousands of years.</p>

<p>Nevertheless an influence of environment must be recognized.
It may be observed, for instance, in the development
of the European after his immigration into America.
It may be recognized in the minute but noticeable differences
of types in various parts of Europe and in different
occupations, in the acceleration of growth of children of
well-to-do classes, and in the stunting and retarding effect
of mal-nutrition. Whether, however, these effects can be
considered as permanent, is a question that is still entirely
open.</p>

<p>Our investigations of the permanence and relationships
of human types have also shown that it is exceedingly
difficult, if not impossible, to find what might be called a
pure type, and the endeavors to find pure races through a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
mixture of which the present variable types may have
originated must be given up. We have recognized that
the transitions between types are so gradual, and in so
many different directions, that the establishment of any
one of the series as a primary type would be quite arbitrary.
All the nations of modern times, and those of Europe
not less than those of other continents, are equally
mixed; and the racial purity on which European nations
like to pride themselves does not exist.</p>

<p>In still other directions have the investigations of anthropology
rudely shattered some of our cherished illusions.
It has been tacitly assumed and loudly proclaimed
that one of the effects of advance in civilization has been
the improvement of the physical organization of the human
body, and particularly of the central nervous system.
At the present time we are not so apt to accept this assumption
as proved. No progressive development of the
nervous system in regard to complexity of connections or
in regard to size has so far been proved. A critical examination
of the facts leaves the desire to feel ourselves as
superiors to our fellow-beings as almost the sole support
of this contention. The question involved is, of course, a
very important one, and forms an aspect of the general
question of the transmission of acquired characters; but
our present attitude can only be one for a demand for
further investigation.</p>

<p>A word should also be said about the question of the difference
of mental ability in different races. Here also the
evidence given by anthropology does not sustain the claim
of superiority of any race over the others. All the arguments
that have been brought forward to prove the superiority
of the white race over all others can readily be
explained by other anthropological considerations. There
<em>are</em> differences in form and size of the brains of different
races, but the variability within each race is so great that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
the small average differences between distinct racial types
are almost insignificant as compared to the total range of
racial variability; and if we base our inferences entirely
on the results of anatomical study, it would seem that
there is no reason to believe that the bulk of the people
constituting two distinct races might not be approximately
on the same level. Nevertheless it seems reasonable to
assume that the differences in form of the body must be
accompanied by differences in function, and we may suppose
that there may be certain peculiarities in the general
mental tendencies of each race, only we must guard
against the inference that divergence from the European
type is synonymous with inferiority.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> history of development of the mental side of anthropology
has been quite different from the growth of physical
anthropology. While in the latter branch of our science
the <em>differences</em> between human types were the first to attract
attention, it was the <em>similarity</em> in cultural types
found in remote regions which first impressed itself upon
ethnologists. A comparison of the descriptions of the customs
of primitive peoples the world over brought out
analogies in ever-increasing number. These were early correlated
with general impressions regarding the degrees of
civilization; and thus it happened that one of the most
difficult and complex problems of ethnologyâ€”namely, the
question of the general typical evolution of the history of
civilization of mankindâ€”was the first to receive attention.
I cannot pass this subject by without mentioning the deep
impression made by men like Tylor and Bachofen, Morgan
and Spencer, who were among the first to present the
data of anthropology as illustrating the history of civilization.</p>

<p>The development of this side of anthropology was
stimulated by the work of Darwin and his successors, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
its fundamental ideas can be understood only as an application
of the theory of biological evolution to mental phenomena.
The conception that the manifestations of ethnic
life represent a series, which from simple beginnings has
progressed to the complex type of modern civilization, has
been the underlying thought of this aspect of anthropological
science.</p>

<p>The arguments in support of the theory that the development
of civilization has followed a similar course
everywhere, and that among primitive tribes we may still
recognize the stages through which our own civilization
has passed, are largely based on the similarities of types
of culture found in distinct races the world over, but also
on the occurrence of peculiar customs in our own civilization,
which can be understood only as survivals of older
customs, that had a deeper significance at an earlier time,
and which are still found in full vigor among primitive
people.</p>

<p>It is necessary to point out at least a few of the aspects
of this general problem, in order to make clear the significance
of the evolutionary theory of human civilization.</p>

<p>The social organization of primitive tribes shows similar
traits in many different parts of the world. Instead of
counting descent in the way we do, many tribes consider
the child as a member only of its motherâ€™s family, and
count blood-relationship only in the maternal line; so that
cousins on the motherâ€™s side are considered as near relatives,
while cousins on the fatherâ€™s side are considered as
only distantly related. Other tribes have a strict paternal
organization, so that the child belongs only to the fatherâ€™s
family, not to the motherâ€™s, while still others follow the
same principles that we adhere to, reckoning relationships
in both directions. Connected with these customs is the
selection of the domicile of the newly married couple, who
sometimes reside with the wifeâ€™s tribe or family, sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
with the manâ€™s tribe or family. When the couple take up
their residence with the social group to which the wife
belongs, it is often found that the man is treated as a
stranger until his first child is born. These phenomena
have been made the subject of thorough studies, and the
observation has been made that apparently the customs of
residence and of descent are closely associated. As a
result of these inquiries the conclusion has been drawn that
everywhere maternal institutions precede paternal institutions,
and that the social organization of mankind was
such that originally perhaps no distinct family organization
existed; that later on maternal institutions developed,
which in turn were followed by paternal institutions, and
again by the system of counting blood-relationship equally
in maternal and paternal lines.</p>

<p>Similar results were obtained by the study of human
inventions. It has been observed that apes and monkeys
sometimes use stones for defence, and in a way the
artificial shelters of animals indicate the beginnings of
invention. In this sense we may seek for the origin of
implements and utensils among animals. In the earliest
times when human remains appear on the surface of the
earth, we find man using simple stone implements which
are formed by rough chipping, but the multiplicity of
forms of implements increases quite rapidly. Since many
implements may have been made of perishable materials,
we are not able to tell whether at a very early time the
implements and utensils used were really confined to the
few stone objects that may now be recovered; but certainly
the implements were few, and, comparatively speaking,
simple. From this time on, the uses of fire, and of tools for
cutting and striking, for scraping and perforating, have
increased in number and complexity, and a gradual development
may be traced from the simple tools of primitive
man to the complex machinery of our times. The inventive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
genius of all races and of unnumbered individuals has contributed
to the state of industrial perfection in which we
find ourselves. On the whole, inventions, once made, have
been kept with great tenacity, and, owing to incessant
additions, the available resources of mankind have constantly
been increased and multiplied.</p>

<p>Researches on art have led to similar results. Investigators
have endeavored to show, that, since the cave-dwellers
of France drew the outlines of the reindeer and
mammoth on bone and antler, man has tried to reproduce
in pictographic design the animals of the region in which
he lived. In the artistic productions of many people, designs
have been found which are readily associated with
pictographic presentations, which, however, have lost their
realism of form, and have become more and more conventional;
so that in many cases a purely decorative motive
has been interpreted as developed from a realistic pictograph,
gradually breaking up under the stress of esthetic
motives. The islands of the Pacific Ocean, New Guinea,
South America, Central America, prehistoric Europe,
have furnished examples for this line of development,
which therefore was recognized as one of the important
tendencies of the evolution of human decorative art, which
was described as beginning with realism, and as leading
through symbolic conventionalism to purely esthetic motives.</p>

<p>Religion has furnished another example of typical evolution
in human thought. At an early time man began to
think and ponder about the phenomena of nature. Everything
appeared to him in an anthropomorphic form of
thought; and thus the first primitive concepts regarding
the world came into being, in which the stone, the mountain,
the heavenly orbs, were viewed as animate anthropomorphic
beings endowed with will-power, and willing to
help man or threatening to endanger him. The observation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
of the activities of manâ€™s own body and of his mind
led to the formulation of the idea of a soul independent
from the body; and with increasing knowledge and with
increasing philosophic thought, religion and science grew
out of these simple beginnings.</p>

<p>The sameness of all these phenomena in different parts
of the world has been considered as proof not only of the
fundamental unity of the mind of all the races of man, but
also of the truth of the theory of evolution of civilization;
and thus a grand structure has been reared, in which we
see our present civilization as the necessary outcome of the
activities of all the races of man, that have risen in one
grand procession, from the simplest beginnings of culture,
through periods of barbarism, to the stage of civilization
that they now occupy. The march has not been equally
rapid; for some are still lagging behind, while others have
forged forward, and occupy the first places in the general
advance.</p>

<p>While this evolutionary aspect has occupied the centre
of attention for a long time, another view of the field of
the phenomena of ethnology was defended by Bastian,â€”a
view which makes its influence felt ever more deeply as
time goes on. The sameness of the forms of thought
found in regions wide apart appeared to Bastian as a
proof of the unity of the human mind, but it also suggested
to him that the forms of thought follow certain
definite types, no matter in what surroundings man may
live, and what may be his social and historical relations.
In the varieties of thought found among peoples of distant
areas he saw the influence of geographical and social
environment upon these fundamental forms of thought,
which were called by him elementary ideas. Bastianâ€™s
theory of the permanence of forms of thought is related
to Diltheyâ€™s conception of the limitation of possible types
of philosophy; and the similarity of the line of thoughts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
these two men appears also clearly in Bastianâ€™s constant
references to the theories of philosophers as compared to
the views held by primitive man. From Bastianâ€™s view-point
the question of a single or multiple type of evolution
of civilization appeared irrelevant. The important phenomenon
in his mind was the fundamental sameness of
forms of human thought in all forms of culture, no matter
whether they were advanced or primitive.</p>

<p>In the views as propounded by him, a certain kind of
mysticism may be recognized, in so far as the elementary
ideas are to his mind intangible entities. No further
thought can possibly unravel their origin, because we ourselves
are compelled to think in the forms of these elementary
ideas.</p>

<p>In a way the evolutionists and Bastian represent thus,
the former the historical point of view, the latter a psychological
point of view, in the field of ethnology. More
recent discussions have taken up both threads of investigation,
and both views are slowly undergoing a number of
radical changes.</p>

<p>With increasing knowledge of the data of anthropology,
the forms of society, of religion, of art, and the development
of invention, do not seem quite so simple as they
appeared to earlier investigators. Attempts were made
to fit the hypothetical typical evolution of mankind to
the historical development of culture in different parts
of the world, so far as it had been reconstructed.
Thus an opportunity was given to examine the correctness
of the accepted theory. As soon as this was
done, peculiar difficulties developed, which showed that
the theory was hardly ever applicable to specific cases,
and that the actual development, as it was traced by historical
reconstruction, differed considerably from the theory.
From this investigation has developed an entirely new
view regarding the relation of different races. We begin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
to recognize that in prehistoric times transmission of cultural
elements has been almost unlimited, and that the
distances over which inventions and ideas have been carried
cover whole continents. As an instance of the rapidity
with which cultural achievements are transmitted, may be
mentioned the modern history of some cultivated plants.
Tobacco was introduced into Africa after the discovery of
America, and it took little time for this plant to spread
over the whole continent; so that at the present time it
enters so deeply into the whole culture of the Negro that
nobody would suspect its foreign origin. We find in the
same way that the banana has pervaded almost the whole
of South America; and the history of Indian-corn is another
example of the incredible rapidity with which a useful
cultural acquisition may spread over the whole world.
The history of the horse, of cattle, of the European grains,
illustrates that similar conditions prevailed in prehistoric
times. These animals and plants occur over the whole
width of the Old World, from the Atlantic Ocean to the
shores of the Pacific. The use of milk was probably disseminated
in a similar way at an early time; so that when
the people of the world enter into our historic knowledge,
we find milk used all over Europe, Africa, and the western
part of Asia.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best proof of transmission is contained in
the folk-lore of the tribes of the world. Nothing seems to
travel as readily as fanciful tales. We know of certain
complex tales, which cannot possibly have been invented
twice, that are told by the Berber in Morocco, by the Italians,
the Irish, the Russians, in the jungles of India, in the
highlands of Tibet, on the tundras of Siberia, and on the
prairies of North America; so that perhaps the only parts
of the world not reached by them are South Africa, Australia,
Polynesia, and South America. The examples of
such transmission are quite numerous, and we begin to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
that the early inter-relation of the races of man was almost
worldwide.</p>

<p>It follows from this observation that the culture of any
given tribe, no matter how primitive it may be, can be
fully explained only when we take into consideration its
inner growth as well as its relation to the culture of its
near and distant neighbors and the effect that they may
have exerted.</p>

<p>The sameness of a number of fundamental ideas and
inventions has suggested to some investigators the belief
that there are old cultural achievements belonging to a
period previous to the general dispersion of the human
race,â€”a theory that has some points in its favor, though
its correctness cannot be proved.</p>

<p>An important theoretical consideration has also shaken
our faith in the correctness of the evolutionary theory as
a whole. It is one of the essential traits of this theory that,
in general, civilization has developed from simple forms to
complex forms, and that extended fields of human culture
have developed under more or less rationalistic impulses.
Of late years we are beginning to recognize that human
culture does not always develop from the simple to the
complex, but that in many aspects two tendencies intercross,â€”one
from the complex to the simple, the other from
the simple to the complex. It is obvious that the history of
industrial development is almost throughout that of increasing
complexity. On the other hand, human activities
that do not depend upon reasoning do not show a similar
type of evolution.</p>

<p>It is perhaps easiest to make this clear by the example of
language, which in many respects is one of the most important
evidences of the history of human development.
Primitive languages are, on the whole, complex. Minute
differences in point of view are given expression by means
of grammatical forms; and the grammatical categories of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
Latin, and still more so those of modern English, seem
crude when compared to the complexity of psychological
or logical forms which primitive languages recognize, but
which in our speech are disregarded entirely. On the whole,
the development of languages seems to be such that the
nicer distinctions are eliminated, and that it begins with
complex and ends with simpler forms, although it must
be acknowledged that opposite tendencies are not by any
means absent.</p>

<p>Similar observations may be made on the art of primitive
man. In music as well as in decorative design we find a
complexity of rhythmic structure which is unequalled in
the popular art of our day. In music, particularly, this
complexity is so great that the art of a skilled virtuoso is
taxed in the attempt to imitate it. If once it is recognized
that simplicity is not always a proof of antiquity, it will
readily be seen that the theory of the evolution of civilization
rests to a certain extent on a logical error. The classification
of the data of anthropology in accordance with their
simplicity has been re-interpreted as an historical sequence,
without an adequate attempt to prove that the simpler
antedated the more complex.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this serious criticism, much of the older
theory seems plausible; but presumably a thorough revision
and a more individualized aspect of the development
of civilization in different parts of the world will become
necessary.</p>

<p>The psychological aspect of anthropology, which was
first emphasized by Bastian, is also undergoing rapid
development, particularly in so far as the problem of the
origin of elementary ideas is concerned, the investigation
of which Bastian considered as impossible. Here, again,
the study of language promises to point the way in which
many of our problems may find their solution. I have
stated before that the languages of primitive tribes are,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
on the whole, complex, and differentiate nicely between
categories of thought. It is very remarkable to find that
these categories, which can be discovered only by an analytical
study of the languages, and which are unknown to
the speakers of these languages, although they are constantly
used, coincide with categories of thought which
have been discovered by philosophers. It would be possible
to find in the languages of primitive people grammatical
forms corresponding to a variety of philosophical
systems; and in this we may perhaps recognize one of the
most brilliant proofs of the correctness of Bastianâ€™s and
Diltheyâ€™s theory of the existence of a limited number of
types of thought.</p>

<p>We infer from these linguistic facts that the categories
of thought, and the forms of action, that we find among a
people, do not need to have been developed by conscious
thought, but that they have grown up owing to the fundamental
organization of the human mind. Linguistic
evidence is of such great value, because grammatical categories
and forms have never risen into the consciousness
of the speaker, while in almost all other ethnological
phenomena people have come to observe what they think
and what they do. With the moment that activities and
thoughts rise into consciousness they become the subject
of speculation; and for this reason the peoples of the world,
primitive as well as more advanced, are ever ready to give
explanations of their customs and beliefs. The importance
of the constant occurrence of such secondary explanations
cannot be overrated. They are ever present. The investigator
who inquires into the history of institutions and of
customs will always receive explanations based on such
secondary interpretation, which, however, do not represent
the history of the custom or belief in question, but only the
results of speculation in regard to it.</p>

<p>I will mention one other psychological point that seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
of special importance in the discussion of the significance
of primitive culture and its relation to more advanced
types. In primitive culture certain activities appear
closely connected which in more advanced types of civilization
have no longer any relation. Thus it is one of the
fundamental traits of primitive culture that social organization
and religious belief are inextricably related. To a
limited extent this tendency persists in our own civilization;
but, on the whole, there has been a marked tendency
to separate social and political organization, and religion.
The same is true of primitive art and religion; and of
primitive science, social organization, and religion. So
far as we are able to investigate the causes for the peculiar
associations between these varied manifestations of ethnic
life and the history of their gradual disappearance, we
find that in the stream of consciousness of primitive man a
sensory stimulus is very liable to release strong emotions,
which are in turn connected with certain groups of ideas.
Thus the emotions common to both establish associations
between groups of ideas that to us appear entirely unrelated.
For the same reason it seems impossible for primitive
man to establish those purely rationalistic associations
between sense-impressions and acts determined by volition
which are characteristic of civilized man. A study of
primitive life shows that particularly every customary action
attains a very strong emotional tone, which increases
the stability of the custom. These forces are still acting in
our own civilization. In order to make this clear, I only
need to remind you of any of those actions which we call
good manners, for which no satisfactory reason can be
given; which nevertheless have acquired an emotional
tone so strong that a breach of good manners is felt
as a grave offence. It would, for instance, be impossible
to give a reason why a gentleman should not be allowed to
keep on his hat indoors, while it is good form for a lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
to do so; and the instantaneous judgment by which we
characterize an offender against these rules as rude, and
the discomfort felt when we unwittingly commit a breach
of good manners, show how deep-seated their emotional
values are.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the further pursuit of the psychological
investigation, which has hardly been begun, will
help us to find a more satisfactory explanation of many
anthropological phenomena than those that we have been
able to give heretofore.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> will perceive that anthropology is a science that is
only beginning to find its own bearings, that many of the
fundamental questions are still open to discussion, and
that the promising lines of approach are just opening.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, anthropology has been able to teach certain
facts that are of importance in our common every-day
life. Owing to the breadth of its outlook, anthropology
teaches better than any other science the relativity of the
values of civilization. It enables us to free ourselves from
the prejudices of our civilization, and to apply standards
in measuring our achievements that have a greater absolute
truth than those derived from a study of our civilization
alone. The differences between our civilization and
another type in which perhaps less stress is laid upon the
rationalistic side of our mental activities and more upon
the emotional side, or in which the outer manifestations of
culture, as expressed in manner and dress, differ from
ours, appear less as differences in <em>value</em> than as differences
in <em>kind</em>. This broader outlook may also help us to recognize
the possibility of lines of progress which do not
happen to be in accord with the dominant ideas of our
times.</p>

<p>Anthropology may also teach a better understanding
of our own activities. We pride ourselves on following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
the dictates of reason and carrying out our carefully
weighed convictions. The fact which is taught by anthropology,â€”that
man the world over <em>believes</em> that he follows
the dictates of reason, no matter how unreasonably he may
act,â€”and the knowledge of the existence of the tendency
of the human mind to arrive at a conclusion first and to
give the reasons afterwards, will help us to open our eyes;
so that we recognize that our philosophic views and our
political convictions are to a great extent determined by
our emotional inclinations, and that the reasons which we
give are not the reasons by which we arrive at our conclusions,
but the explanations which we give for our conclusions.</p>

<p>An important lesson is also taught by the course the
general development of society has taken. Primitive social
units were small, and the members possessed a strong feeling
of solidarity among themselves and of hostility against
all aliens. The social units have been increasing in size
through all ages. Greater individual freedom was allowed
to the members of the groups, and the feeling of hostility
against strangers weakened. We are still in the middle of
this development; and the history of mankind shows that
any policy which oversteps the limits of necessary self-protection
and seeks advancement of one nation by a
policy disregarding the interests of others is bound to lose
in the long-run, because it represents an older type of
thought that is gradually disappearing.</p>

<p>I cannot leave my subject without saying a word in regard
to the help that anthropological methods may render
in the investigation of problems of public hygiene, of race-mixture,
and of eugenics. The safe methods of biological
and psychological anthropometry and anthropology
will help us to remove these questions from the sphere of
heated political discussion and to make them subjects of
calm scientific investigation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I have tried to outline in this imperfect picture the
methods, aims, and hopes of anthropology. The definite
facts that I could lay before you are few, and even the
ground-work of the science appears hardly laid. Still
I hope that the view of our ultimate aims may have engendered
the feeling that we are striving for a goal which
is bound to enlighten mankind, and which will be helpful in
gaining a right attitude in the solution of the problems of
life.</p>
